# A novel deep learning-based method for generating floor response spectra of building structures  
## This repository for FRSNet
The FRSNet can predict the FRS efficiently without requiring numerical simulation and model analysis.
This repository contains the following content:
1. The dataset are provided in 'dataset' folder.
2. Loss of the final model is provided in loss.zip.
3. Model architecture and its code is provided in FRSNet.png and FRSNet.ipynb.
4. The code of the compared models(DNN,CNN,LSTM).
5. The code of excitation interpolation method.
6. The best trained model are provided in models.zip.
